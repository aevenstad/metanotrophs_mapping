Pipeline used to process SRAs

## Files:
* `taxprofiler.slurm` batch script to run taxprofiler pipeline. Was ran on compute nodes on Saga HPC.
* `local.config` Nextflow config file for taxprofiler. Set to continue pipeline if some SRAs fail fastp or fastqc process.
* `databases.csv` database sheet that links to a few databases on Saga. These are not used in the actual run of taxprofiler since we only run the steps before the actual profiling, but the argument `--databases` is mandatory.
* `fix_samplesheet.R` R script that processes the original taxprofiler samplesheet generated by fetchngs. 
* `samplesheet_taxprofiler.csv.gz` Samplesheet from fetchngs.
* `samplesheet_taxprofiler_removed_bad_commas.csv.gz` Samplesheet from fetchngs where certain problematic commas have been replaced.
* `samplesheet_taxprofiler_final.csv` Final samplesheet used as taxprofiler input.
